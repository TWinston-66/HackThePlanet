**Here is the [link](https://tryhackme.com/room/crackthehash) to the original challenge page**


### Rooms
The rooms that are offered by TryHackMe, are an excellent way to learn cyber security through gamified real-world labs. 
To view the writeups for a certain room, just visit its page linked from the menu on the left or click the button below.

Remember that for each room you need to connect to the TryHackMe VPN 

Then start the room's machine if it has one

A good guide for this can be found [here](https://tryhackme.com/access)...
