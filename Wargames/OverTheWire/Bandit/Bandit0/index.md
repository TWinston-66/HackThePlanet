The goal of this Level is to log into the game

To accomplish this we need to be able to use the service ssh

- Type the command `ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

This connects to the host `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` with the user `bandit0` via ssh on port `2220` 

- Enter the password `bandit0`

This is the given password for the user `bandit0` 

Once you have connected then proceed to Level 0-1

##### After each level you can use the `clear` command to clear the screen for a fresh start each level
