<p>The goal is this level is to to locate a file that is somewhere on the server that has a certain size and is owned by certain a certain user and group</p>

<p>To accomplish this we are going to once again use the find command</p>

<p>First we need to log onto the level</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220</code></li>
  <li>Enter the password <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If we do a quick search for any files in the home directory using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command we can see that nothing gets outputted</p>

<p>This means the file is most likely hidden</p>

<p>So we are going to execute the search from the home directory</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We are using the find command to find our password file with those specifications</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> part of the command is to look for all files</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-user bandit7 -group bandit6</code> part is looking for a file that is owned by both that user and that group</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-size 33c</code> part is looking for a file that is 33 bytes in size</p>

<p>When this command is run we get a list of files that it found matching those requirements</p>

<p>However we can see that we do not have permission to view all of the files except one</p>

<p>That one file we can work with is our password file that is called…</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password</code></p>

<p>We can read the data from that file using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> command</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Then the password for the next level gets outputted</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy the password <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs</code></li>
  <li>Type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> to logout</li>
</ul>
